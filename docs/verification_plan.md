# Verification Plan

## Overview

The verification plan outlines the strategy and methodologies to be used for verifying the functionality, performance, and reliability of the JTAG/1500/1687 network design. The goal is to ensure that the design meets all specified requirements and operates correctly under all conditions.

## Verification Strategy

1. **Unit Testing**:
   - Verify individual modules (JTAG controller, boundary scan chain, loop-back module) in isolation.

2. **Integration Testing**:
   - Verify the interaction between integrated modules to ensure seamless operation.

3. **Regression Testing**:
   - Perform regression tests to ensure that new changes do not introduce errors.

4. **Coverage Analysis**:
   - Use coverage tools to ensure high code coverage and identify any untested paths.

## Test Benches

1. **JTAG Controller Test Bench**:
   - Verify JTAG state machine transitions.
   - Test boundary scan and loop-back functionalities.

2. **Boundary Scan Chain Test Bench**:
   - Verify data shifting and parallel input/output operations.

3. **Loop-Back Module Test Bench**:
   - Verify correct data loop-back functionality.

4. **Top Module Test Bench**:
   - Verify the integrated operation of the JTAG controller, boundary scan chain, and loop-back module.

## Tools and Methodologies

1. **Simulation**:
   - Use Icarus Verilog and Vivado for functional simulation of the design.
   - Verify the design under various test scenarios and conditions.

2. **Synthesis**:
   - Use Yosys and Vivado for synthesizing the design.
   - Verify the synthesized design against timing and resource constraints.

3. **Coverage Analysis**:
   - Use Verilator and Vivado for coverage analysis.
   - Ensure that all functional paths are tested and covered.

## Verification Metrics

1. **Functional Coverage**:
   - Ensure that all specified functionalities are verified.
   - Use coverage reports to identify any missing test cases.

2. **Code Coverage**:
   - Achieve at least 90% code coverage for all modules.
   - Use coverage tools to measure and report code coverage.

3. **Performance Metrics**:
   - Verify that the design meets performance requirements (latency, throughput).
   - Use performance analysis tools to measure and optimize performance.

## Reporting

1. **Verification Reports**:
   - Generate detailed verification reports after each test run.
   - Include information on test cases, coverage metrics, and any identified issues.

2. **Coverage Reports**:
   - Generate coverage reports to highlight tested and untested paths.
   - Use coverage reports to guide additional testing efforts.
