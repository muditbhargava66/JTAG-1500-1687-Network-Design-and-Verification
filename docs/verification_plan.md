# Verification Plan

## Overview

This verification plan outlines the strategy and methodologies for verifying the JTAG/1500/1687 Network design. The plan covers all aspects of verification including unit testing, integration testing, and system-level verification, with a focus on ensuring compliance with the relevant IEEE standards.

## Verification Strategy

### Hierarchical Verification
The verification follows a hierarchical approach to ensure thorough testing at all levels:

1. **Unit Testing**:
   - Verify individual modules (JTAG controller, boundary scan chain, IEEE 1500 wrapper, IEEE 1687 network) in isolation
   - Focus on functional correctness of each component

2. **Integration Testing**:
   - Verify interactions between integrated modules
   - Ensure seamless operation of connected components
   - Test mode switching and proper multiplexing

3. **System-Level Verification**:
   - Verify the complete system with all components integrated
   - Test end-to-end scenarios through the top module
   - Verify compliance with IEEE standards

### Standard Compliance Testing
Special attention is given to ensuring compliance with relevant IEEE standards:

1. **IEEE 1149.1 (JTAG) Compliance**:
   - Verify correct state machine transitions
   - Test standard instruction operation
   - Validate boundary scan operations

2. **IEEE 1500 Compliance**:
   - Verify wrapper interface functionality
   - Test core isolation and access
   - Validate wrapper instruction and data registers

3. **IEEE 1687 Compliance**:
   - Verify instrument access network
   - Test segment insertion bit operation
   - Validate instrument selection and control

- Verify data integrity during scan operations

### IEEE 1500 Wrapper Test Bench
- Verify wrapper instruction register operations
- Test wrapper data register functionality
- Validate different test modes (EXTEST, INTEST, BYPASS, etc.)
- Verify core isolation and access mechanisms

### IEEE 1687 Network Test Bench
- Verify segment insertion bit operations
- Test instrument selection and access
- Validate data and control signals for instruments
- Verify scan path reconfiguration

### Top Module Test Bench
- Verify integration of all components

- Verify signal integrity across component boundaries

## Verification Methods

### Directed Testing
- Create specific test cases to verify known functionality
- Focus on corner cases and edge conditions
- Validate compliance with standards specifications
- Test specific failure modes and recovery

### Randomized Testing
- Generate random test sequences to explore state space
- Create randomized data patterns for scan chains
- Vary timing parameters within specification limits
- Identify unexpected behaviors and corner cases

### Assertion-Based Verification
- Implement SystemVerilog assertions to verify protocol compliance
- Monitor state transitions for correctness
- Check for protocol violations during operation
- Ensure design constraints are maintained

### Coverage Analysis
- Implement functional coverage points for critical features
- Track code coverage (line, branch, toggle) for all modules
- Identify uncovered scenarios for additional testing
- Set coverage goals for verification completion

## Verification Metrics

### Code Coverage Targets
- Line coverage: 95% or higher
- Branch coverage: 90% or higher
- Toggle coverage: 85% or higher
- Condition coverage: 90% or higher

### Functional Coverage Targets
- JTAG state transitions: 100% of all valid transitions
- Instruction register: 100% of defined instructions
- IEEE 1500 modes: 100% of operation modes
- IEEE 1687 SIB configurations: 100% of valid configurations

### Performance Verification
