# Test Strategy

## Overview

The test strategy outlines the approach to be taken for testing the JTAG/1500/1687 network design. It covers the types of testing to be performed, the tools to be used, and the methodologies to be followed to ensure a robust and reliable design.

## Test Types

1. **Functional Testing**:
   - Verify that the design meets all specified functional requirements.
   - Use directed and random test cases to cover various scenarios.

2. **Integration Testing**:
   - Verify the interaction between integrated modules.
   - Ensure that the integrated system operates correctly as a whole.

3. **Regression Testing**:
   - Perform regression tests to ensure that new changes do not introduce errors.
   - Use automated test scripts to run regression tests regularly.

4. **Performance Testing**:
   - Measure the performance of the design (latency, throughput).
   - Optimize the design to meet performance requirements.

5. **Coverage Analysis**:
   - Use coverage tools to ensure high code and functional coverage.
   - Identify any untested paths and create additional test cases as needed.

## Tools and Environments

1. **Simulation**:
   - Use Icarus Verilog and Vivado for functional simulation.
   - Verify the design under various test scenarios and conditions.

2. **Synthesis**:
   - Use Yosys and Vivado for synthesizing the design.
   - Verify the synthesized design against timing and resource constraints.

3. **Coverage Analysis**:
   - Use Verilator and Vivado for coverage analysis.
   - Ensure that all functional paths are tested and covered.

## Test Methodologies

1. **Directed Testing**:
   - Create directed test cases to verify specific functionalities and scenarios.
   - Ensure that all functional requirements are covered.

2. **Random Testing**:
   - Use random test case generation to cover a wide range of scenarios.
   - Identify any corner cases or unexpected behaviors.

3. **Automated Testing**:
   - Use automated test scripts to run tests regularly.
   - Integrate automated testing with continuous integration (CI) pipelines.

4. **Manual Testing**:
   - Perform manual testing for scenarios that are difficult to automate.
   - Use manual testing to validate the overall system behavior.

## Reporting

1. **Test Reports**:
   - Generate detailed test reports after each test run.
   - Include information on test cases, test results, and any identified issues.

2. **Coverage Reports**:
   - Generate coverage reports to highlight tested and untested paths.
   - Use coverage reports to guide additional testing efforts.

## Test Metrics

1. **Test Case Coverage**:
   - Ensure that all specified functionalities are covered by test cases.
   - Use test case coverage metrics to identify any missing tests.

2. **Code Coverage**:
   - Achieve at least 90% code coverage for all modules.
   - Use coverage tools to measure and report code coverage.

3. **Defect Metrics**:
   - Track the number and severity of defects identified during testing.
   - Use defect metrics to guide testing and debugging efforts.
