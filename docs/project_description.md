# Project Description

## Overview

The JTAG/1500/1687 Network Design and Verification project involves the design, implementation, and verification of JTAG, IEEE 1500, and IEEE 1687 networks for digital logic, embedded memories, and PHY/IOs. The project aims to create a robust system that facilitates efficient testing and debugging of integrated circuits.

## Objectives

- Design a JTAG controller with boundary scan and loop-back features.
- Implement IEEE 1500 and 1687 networks for enhanced testability.
- Develop comprehensive test benches for functional verification.
- Automate simulation, synthesis, and coverage analysis processes.
- Ensure high code coverage and compliance with industry standards.
