# Requirements

## Functional Requirements

1. **JTAG Controller**:
   - Must support standard JTAG operations (e.g., Test-Logic-Reset, Run-Test/Idle, Shift-IR, Shift-DR).
   - Must include boundary scan and loop-back functionalities.

2. **IEEE 1500 Network**:
   - Must support standard IEEE 1500 operations.
   - Must interface with JTAG controller.

3. **IEEE 1687 Network**:
   - Must support standard IEEE 1687 operations.
   - Must provide a seamless interface for embedded instruments.

4. **Test Benches**:
   - Must verify functionality of JTAG controller, boundary scan chain, and loop-back module.
   - Must achieve high code coverage.

## Non-Functional Requirements

1. **Performance**:
   - The design should be optimized for low latency and high throughput.

2. **Scalability**:
   - The system should be easily extendable for additional features and components.

3. **Maintainability**:
   - The codebase should be well-documented and modular to facilitate maintenance and updates.
